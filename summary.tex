This project proposes investigating mathematically-principled machine learning techniques to model ocean dynamics. The proposed research is divided into three thrusts. 

(1) Learning dynamics with symmetry constraints. In this thrust, we focus on machine learning approaches towards the closure problem in fluid dynamics. The proposed approach incorporates physical symmetries to the machine learning model. We also investigate end-to-end emulation of the dynamics and hybrid methods.

(2) Modeling real data with broken symmetries. In this thrust, we propose to investigate machine learning approaches on real data. In particular, we will investigate whether relaxations of the physical constraints are more useful to model real data than the exact physical symmetries and conservation laws.

(3) Adversarial attacks and robustness. In this thrust we investigate whether incorporating physical priors to the the machine learning models empirically improves their robustness.

This project combines the expertise of PIs Laure Zanna and David Hogg at NYU, and Kaze Wong and Soledad Villar at JHU. It will mentor 3 PhD students and one undergraduate student.
